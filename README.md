# Enigma-Workspace
Enigma Machine - A Simulation
This program virtualizes the Enigma Machine, an encrypting device used in the World War 2. It's a fun way to explore the inner workings of the machine which was once truly an enigma to solve. This project was developed in Python to fulfill the course requirements for my Fundamentals of Programming semester project.
The main code file is the mainmodule. Other dependent files are also included with the projet.
